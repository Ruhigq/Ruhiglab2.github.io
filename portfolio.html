        <h3>Web Development for a Small Business</h3>

        <h3>Programming in C++</h3>
        <p>For a course project at university, I wrote an image recognition program using C++. The program used the OpenCV library for image preprocessing and feature extraction and was able to recognize specific markers in medical images. I used the multi-threading feature of C++ to increase the running speed of the program and eventually managed to reduce the processing time by 40%. This project not only honed my C++ skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of image processing.</p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>In college, I participated in a competition called "Python Programming Marathon" and worked with my team to develop an automated water management system. We used Python to build a prototype that could monitor water quality and levels in real-time, and successfully integrated it with a user-friendly front-end interface. At the end of the competition, our project won first place, which not only improved my programming skills but also honed my teamwork skills.</p>
